# Facebook-clone
Facebook Login Page Clone This project is a clone of the Facebook login page, created using HTML and CSS. As a self-taught developer, I built this project to enhance my web development skills and practice designing with HTML and CSS. The aim is to replicate the look and feel of the original Facebook login page as closely as possible.
